Capstone Project

For my project, I would like to make a cooking app using an API to gather recipes and information. It should have a library of all recipes, list ingredients needed for each recipe, and allow users to search recipes by ingredients used. The UI should be user friendly to allow the users to follow along while they cook.

Alternative ideas:
I will make a fun app that generates random facts about cats and shares it with the user. It would also have a section for viewing random pictures of cats. Authenticated users can submit new cat facts and pictures.

Another project idea could be a meme generator app. The app would have a library of images and allow the user to add text to the image. Authenticated users could add new images to the meme library.
